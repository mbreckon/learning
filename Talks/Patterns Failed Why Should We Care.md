## Patterns Failed - Why should we care? - Brian Marick
https://www.deconstructconf.com/2017/brian-marick-patterns-failed-why-should-we-care

**Key points**
* Design patterns missed the mark
    * Proposition: the building blocks in the GoF are basically just Functions and Polymorphism (via inheritance) which is in contrast to the deeply rich relationships of building blocks in Christopher Alexander's book "A Pattern Language". The resulting minimal "interconnection between the patterns pushes you towards a very mechanistic implementation-focused application of the pattern".

* "And you flip there, and you ignore the bullet lists, and you look for this. And you get the class diagram, and you basically copy and paste it into your code, and you're done. So that is a different way of using patterns than the one everyone was shooting for." 

* Design patterns have a bad reputation - quoted example "We didn't use design patterns. It was pretty much just a set of ideas. We just took this concept and took some inspiration from it". The point: THAT IS WHAT DESIGN PATTERNS ARE.

* Code smells are all about practical knowledge (Greek: metis) - "the kind of knowledge that can be acquired only by long practice in similar but rarely identical tasks, which requires constant adaptation to changing circumstances."

**My thoughts**

* Perhaps DDD (Eric Evans) is closer to the mark as Brian suggests. Perhaps there needs to be a real patterns book for making code a better place to inhabit. (it certainly seems to me that DDD has got as bad if not worse a reputation amongst certain sections of the programmer community). Certainly if there is such a thing as OO "done right" then we should expect a new set of patterns. 

**Further reading**
* I'm going to have to look at the GoF book again as I do think there was some attempt to describe set of relationships between the patterns in a diagram similar to the one Brian shows from Christopher Alexander's book. 
* Read the original "A pattern language" book - it is mentioned all the time by Kevlin Henney and others. Might be time to see what the fuss is about.
