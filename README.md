# Introduction
I've recently decided to go back to the original sources on a range of software engineering and CS topics in order to deepen and strengthen my current practice. My current practice has come from a university degree, observing others, reading blog posts and books, and building various pieces of software over the past 25 years.

This repository consists of notes and observations from three main sources of learning:

| Learning | Introduction | Observation | Queue
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| Papers | [Introduction](Papers/Intrpduction.md) | [Observations](Papers/Observations.md) | [Queue](Papers/Queue.md)
| Talks | [Introduction](Talks/Introduction.md) | [Observations](Talks/Observations.md) | [Queue](Talks/Queue.md)
| Code Walkthroughs | [Introduction](Walkthroughs/Introduction.md) |[Observations](Walkthroughs/Observations.md) | [Queue](Walkthroughs/Queue.md)


Each section has a queue of possible source items that might be of interest to others.
