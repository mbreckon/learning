### Why bother reading all these old papers?

A lot of it comes from a realisation that it is possible to be a perfectly acceptable practicioner - writing clean code, thinking through designs, making sensible architecture choices etc. by reading all the current theories and listening to the latest talks, but to grow you need a strong conceptual model beyond just learnt practice (no matter how broad). Building that conceptual model generally means going beyond your teachers to their teachers. As Kevlin Henney has recently very clearly stated, there is much from the early days of computing that is still relevant. It is a constant surprise to see statements of problems that are still with us today (albeit generally on a different scale). 

### What to expect in this repository

Every week or two I'm going to be looking at a paper - long enough to read, re-read and mull over its contents and implications. Then I'll write a few notes up here. I can't gaurantee they'll be original or even interesting thoughts but if anybody actually ends up reading them then perhaps they'll go and read the original papers for themselves.
