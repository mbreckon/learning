## [LIEBetal88] Object-Oriented Programming: An Objective Sense of Style, OOPSLA'88 Conference Proceedings, September 1988.

**Key Points** 

The central claim appears to be...

If you **simultaneously minimise**:
1. Code duplication
2. Number of method arguments
3. Number of methods per class

**...whilst following the Law of Demeter**... 

You will see...
1. Less coupling between methods
2. Better information hiding
3. Narrower interfaces
4. Methods that are easier to re-use
5. Easier correctness proofs using structural induction
6. Easier software maintenance

... More to come here...

**Things to look into in more depth**

* What is a "correctness proof using structural induction"?
